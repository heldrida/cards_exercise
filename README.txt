JavaScript exercise

We’d like you to create an application that displays some cards and allows the user to do some simple card manipulation.

You should also have “playing-cards.png” – an image showing all available cards in a standard deck – although feel free to find and use your own images if you like.

The Task

The cards start in consecutive order.

Present the user with a simple page that has three buttons “Shuffle”, “Deal” and “Reset”. You may wish to add an image of a deck of cards face down.

When the “Shuffle” button is clicked then the cards in the deck should be placed in a random order.

When the “Deal” button is clicked then five cards are shown face up to the user, taken from the top of the deck. The new cards replace the cards already dealt (if there are any). The used cards are placed on the bottom of the deck.

When the “Reset” button is clicked then all cards are removed from display and the card deck is set back to the original consecutive order. 

Styling and Other Guidelines

We work to W3C standards at MRM London, so please impress us with your knowledge of these standards.

The solution should work cross browser, however for this exercise don’t spend lots of time testing in many browsers.

We think a couple of hours should be enough to get to a working solution but feel free to embellish as you like. If there are areas where you would improve your solution given more time then note these as comments in the code.
