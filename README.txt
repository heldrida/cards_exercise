JavaScript exercise

Application that displays some cards and allows the user to do some simple card manipulation.

The Task

The cards start in consecutive order.

Present the user with a simple page that has three buttons “Shuffle”, “Deal” and “Reset”. You may wish to add an image of a deck of cards face down.

When the “Shuffle” button is clicked then the cards in the deck should be placed in a random order.

When the “Deal” button is clicked then five cards are shown face up to the user, taken from the top of the deck. The new cards replace the cards already dealt (if there are any). The used cards are placed on the bottom of the deck.

When the “Reset” button is clicked then all cards are removed from display and the card deck is set back to the original consecutive order.
